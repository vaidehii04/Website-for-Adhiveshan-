Mandir Explorer — How to Get Started
🛕 About This Project

This website was built for Adhiveshan as a showcase of all five BAPS mandirs in North America — their history, details, vibes, the whole deal. It’s basically your mini–virtual yatra.
Oh, and btw… I won the skills competition with this project.
Yes.
Correct.
Flex on ’em. 🎉💅

🚀 Opening the Website
Head into the public folder.
Double-click index.html to launch the site in your browser.
Works on Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox — pretty much anything that isn’t fossil-level outdated.

🌟 Want the Smoothest Experience? (Optional)
If you're using VS Code with the Live Server extension:
Open the project folder in VS Code.
In the Explorer sidebar, right-click index.html.
Hit “Open with Live Server.”
Your site will appear at a local link like:
http://127.0.0.1:5500/public/index.html
(That link only works on your own machine while Live Server is running — no sharable magic here unfortunatley)
